# R18 Uncensor CSV

Javinizer can utilize a csv file to replace censored words on R18 with the uncensored counterparts.

```
# Opens the uncensor replacement csv file
C:\> Javinizer -OpenUncensor
```

The default file Javinizer uses is the `jvUncensor.csv` file located in the root module folder. Javinizer can use a custom path defined by the `location.uncensorcsv` setting.
